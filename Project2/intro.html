This typeface design is inspired by the guest speaker Yuin Chien. After seeing her alphabet project, I decided to create my own css alphabet by using grids and different border radiuses. After the alphabet was finished, I noticed that the negative spaces created by the border radiuses looked a lot like stars, so I decided to name my typeface STARR. <br/><br/>
The graphic design of my website was based on the name that I chose for the typeface. I used Javascript to generate stars in the background to make it more visually interesting, and added a semi transparent layer of black blurs that moves on top of the stars to make them look like they are blinking. Since the typeface looks more compelling when it's large, I made seperated pages for each large letter. In addition, I also applied a gradient animation to the characters.<br/><br/>
Overall, I think I have learned a lot from doing this project. This is the first time I have ever designed a typeface on my own, and I am glad that I was able to create it with code. I look forward to doing more projects like this in the future.
