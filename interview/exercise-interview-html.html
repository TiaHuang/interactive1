		What is ‘good’ screen-based design?
		</b></p>

  		<p>
		Obviously, everything is supposed to be easy to read. The web style should fit the content. Sometimes it's good to professional, and sometimes it's nice to be more flexible. It depends on the kind of website that you're designing. Also, I think it is important to make sure that the viewers can access and understand the information on the screen with no problem. Sure it is nice to make a website or app pretty, but they have to make sense and work properly for the users first.

  		<p><b>
		What do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?
  		</b></p>

		<p>
		The web is for people to browse information and to share and connect with the rest of the world. Like Twitter is a website which people can use to post texts and images, message others, and see what other people are sharing. It connects people from all over the world; I can see the same information at the same time as someone else in Russia. So basically users of the web from diffrent regions can access the same information easily, and it is very convenient.

  		<p><b>
		How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?
		</b></p>

  		<p>
		It is more efficient to browse news. As technology develops, people are gaining more and more immediate updates to news from all around the world. As a platform where people can exchange information, there are more opportunities for people to promote themselves. When an earthquake occurs, I get to know where the center is immediately.
